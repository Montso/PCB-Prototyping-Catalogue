# Smart Home Solar Power Management

### The problem

Nowadays, installing solar photovoltaic panels on big city buildings is limited to the roof area of the building. This means little power generation capabilities for energy savings when considering each individual apartment.


<br>

### The idea

The idea of this "Smart Home Solar Power Management" Project is to develop simple components and accessories that enable easy, "for dummies" kind of installation of solar photovoltaic cells. For that to happen is required installation of one or two additional electrical wiring in the apartment's electrical wiring . Staring with a 5V DC wiring suitable for most small home appliances such as vacuum cleaners, smartphones, tablets , and any other smart device or technology. And another with 12V DC suited for computers , gaming consoles and OLED TV displays. 

Energy storage methodology follows a decentralized architecture of installation, where each individual room or compartment has its own "independent" battery storage up to 40.000mAh.  All connected to any Smart Home device i make available here on my GitHub.  

In regards to the solar panels , these can be assembled in a lego style kind of way. Due to the reduced photovoltaic solar cells, can be assmbled into any shapre or area. For instance glass door windows and doors. For instance in a terrasse or a terrasse exterior wall regardelsss of floor area shape.

### Current Status of Development

The current status of development of this project has now the following preliminary conclusions:

- A dressing room with an area of 20-25 m2 and with a glass window where the sun shines only in early morning can be powered 
  - by a single photovoltaic 6V DC solar cell for micro LED illumination usages of up to 5 to 10min a day and at night. 
- A bathroom with an area of 20-25 m2 , indoors no glass windows , with glossy tile walls , micro LED illumination produces the best light

Initially i was aiming at an additional 10 euro a month savings on the utilities bill , however, recent prototypes show that is possible to repurpose any apartment on any big city to become independent of the main power grid for the following home appliances :

  - indoor illumination
  - small home appliances such as a battery powered vacuum cleaner , manual operated or a robot
  - Smart devices such as smartphones, tablets or any other smart appliance
  - OLED TV screens, and laptop computers

Additional energy savings can be achieved, if installed with a "home occupancy management system" to monitor occupants habits:
- to provide an optimized electricity usage schedule to each of the occupants
- to detect empty an room/ compartment
- to regulate light intensity during evenings and at night before going to bed.  Synchronizing with the human biological clock cycles.
