# Solar Power for Smart Homes

**The problem**

Nowadays, installing solar photovoltaic panels on big city buildings is limited to the roof area of the building. This means little power generation capabilities for energy savings when considering each individual apartment.

<br>

**The idea**

The idea of this "Smart Home Solar Power Management" Project is to develop simple components and accessories that enable easy, "for dummies" kind of installation of solar photovoltaic cells. For that to happen is required installation of additional wiring in the apartment electrical network. Staring with a 5V DC wire, suitable for most small home appliances such as vacuum cleaners, smartphones, tablets, and any other smart device or technology. And another with 12V DC suited for computers, gaming consoles, and OLED TV displays. This can be achieved by installing "power delivery" technologies, common in USB-C power solutions.

Energy storage methodology follows a decentralized architecture of installation, where each individual room or compartment has its own "independent" battery storage upwards 40.000mAh. All connected to a Smart Home device I made available , here, on my Github.
The solar panels can be assembled in a Lego-style kind of way. Due to the reduced size of the photovoltaic solar cells, can be assembled into any shape or area. For instance glass door windows and doors. For instance in a terrasse or a terrasse exterior wall regardless of floor area shape.

### Legend
ðŸŸ¢ **Hardware or firmware fully tested and working** <br>
A green circle means the hardware electronics or the firmware programming code was fully tested, each of its functionalities and capabilities. And it can be installed in a vehicle. Keep in mind this does not mean errors won't happen. As in everything related to electronics and software, there are revisions and updates. This open hardware is no different.

ðŸŸ¡ **Hardware or firmware not tested. Working capability is unknown, it may work or not.** <br>
A yellow circle means the hardware electronics or the firmware programming code was not fully tested, each of its functionalities and capabilities. This does not mean it not working , it simply means testing is needed before giving a green circle of approval.  

ðŸ”´ **Hardware or firmware fully tested but not working.** <br>
A red circle means the hardware electronics or the firmware programming code was fully tested, and found some kind of critical error or fault. This means the electronics or firmware code cannot be used in a vehicle. 

âŒ› **Hardware Design / firmware programming not started.** <br>
The hour glass means the hardware electronics or the firmware programming hasn't started. Most likely because is waiting for the necessary test components needed for reverse engineering and also engineering of the new open solution. 

ðŸ†• **New updated contents** <br>
The new icon means the link next to it was recently updated with new contents 

ðŸ’¬  **Comments on the Discussion page** <br>
The comments icon means there are usefeul and even new comments on the [discussions page](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-AI-Volvo-MKII-Open-Hardware/discussions) important for what you are seeing or reading.
