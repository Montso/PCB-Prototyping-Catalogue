This public PCB catalogue features PCB desings that are not fully tested or require minor changes to the PCB or shcematics. Suited to all DIY and Makers in electronics, however a regular user may find him/her self in need to read components datasheets before any usage of the PCB is possible.

If time (or datasheets) are not your thing, there are more PCB designs with circuit schematics fully tested and working ready to download, available to all who donate or sponsor my open hardware work. Click [here for fully tested PCB designs and circuit chematics](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/Fully-Tested-Working-PCB-Catalogue). To order a custom PCB acording to your specifications and needs , go [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/custom_PCB).

This Smart Indoor plant monitoring and watering is designed to be inserted into any indoor plant vase. Is able to measure and calculate the moisture content in the vase, and when detects low water contents, activates the water pump. Is able to connect to a local home server to upload indoor temperature, humidity, and air quality measurement data. This way, the owner, can have a history record database, without the need for expensive cloud subscriptions.  Additionally, it features a 6 LED system composed of an ultraviolet LED, an Infrared LED and an RGB LED, when combined with multiple devices like this one in the same room is able to perform some basic light aggression protection from an unknown light source outside during the night & day.
