This public PCB catalogue features PCB desings that are not fully tested or require minor changes to the PCB or shcematics. Suited to all DIY and Makers in electronics, however a regular user may find him/her self in need to read components datasheets before any usage of the PCB is possible.

If time (or datasheets) are not your thing, there are more PCB designs with circuit schematics fully tested and working ready to download, available to all who donate or sponsor my open hardware work. Click [here for fully tested PCB designs and circuit chematics](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/Fully-Tested-Working-PCB-Catalogue). To order a custom PCB acording to your specifications and needs , go [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/custom_PCB).


## [Home Automation](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/Home-Automation/README.md)
- [Smart Coffee Machine Addon](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Home-Automation-Smart-Coffee-MAchine-Addon)

This repo contains the KiCad files for the Smart Coffee Machine Add-on. This PCB adds WiFi and BLE capabilities to any home or office coffee machine. Is able to control the water boiler temperature; remotely order a cup of coffee (with the possibility to control of the quantity of coffee in the cup); grind coffee beans. 
Don't forget to check out some cool photos of assembly on a Philips Senseo Coffee Machine [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Home-Automation-Smart-Coffee-MAchine-Addon/tree/main/Philips%20Senseo)
