# Smart Wireless Wave Safety

### Available PCB Designs as KiCad Project files for DIY and Makers

[<img src="https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/tindie_amazing_small.jpg" alt="" height="60">](https://www.tindie.com/stores/aeonlabs/)


This public PCB catalogue features PCB desings that are not fully tested or require minor changes to the PCB or shcematics. Suited to all DIY and Makers in electronics, however a regular user may find him/her self in need to read components datasheets before any usage of the PCB is possible.

If time (or datasheets) are not your thing, there are more PCB designs with circuit schematics fully tested and working ready to download, available to all who donate or sponsor my open hardware work. Click [here for fully tested PCB designs and circuit chematics](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/Fully-Tested-Working-PCB-Catalogue). To order a custom PCB acording to your specifications and needs , go [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/custom_PCB).

### Safety usage of the smart devices provied below

The smart safety & health solutions available below, are for the kind of wireless agression that behave like ripples in a pond. 

**Are not able to detect wireless* targeted to a person's body and individual. For instance using a beam forming device or technology**. 

When insalling any of the solutions provided below, take action and be counscient the agression/ agressor may change to other types and kinds of "wireless devices" the smart devices below are unable to detect. 

Always use the smart devices below conencted to a public data reposity wiht LIVE data streams. While at the same time, notice authorities and provide the web address link where the public data repository can be found. 

**Be advised**
