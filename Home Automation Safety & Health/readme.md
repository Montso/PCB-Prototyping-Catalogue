## Safety usage of the smart devices provided below

The smart safety & health solutions available below, are for the kind of wireless aggression that behaves like ripples in a pond. For instance Wireless electromagnetic radios, including those found on smartphones, tablets, WIFI routers at home, and many more. (except those with directional beam forming technologies). This type of aggressions have the characteristic to happen only during short periods of time, in the order of milliseconds or less regardless of electromagnetic radiation conditions and threshold limits of wireless networks.  

Two concepts are very important to know and learn about: 
- the **superposition of different electromagnetic waves**, its meanings and what resulting wave and EM energy produces (for instance an energy spike that produces an instantaneous flash of light).
- and the second concept is **wave pattern matching** to produce an EM wave with higher energy (for instance an high voltage , low amperage corona effect similar to those possible to see during a thunderstorm).

These concepts and subjects can be found easily on google and in scientific publications.   


**The devices listed below are not able to detect wireless aggressions targeted to a person's body and individual. For instance, using some kind of beam-forming device or technologies**. For example, Laser and laser-like kind of devices and kind of technologies. 

**When installing any of the solutions provided below, take action and be conscient the aggression/aggressor may change to other types and kinds of "wireless devices" the smart devices below are unable to detect**.  

**Always use the smart devices below connected to a public data repository with LIVE data streams. While at the same time, notify the authorities immediately and provide the web address link where the public data repository can be found**. To my knowledge, data repositories based on Harvard's www.dataverse.org are currently the most suited (not ideal) for the smart solutions provided below. 

 :warning: **Be advised**


Known open data repositories partial compatible with these smart devices:
- www.dataverse.org [partial compatible] (open firmware provided here uses a dataverse repository API)
- www.figshare.com [partial compatible]
- www.datadryad.org [not compatible; no API]

</div>

## How to proceed
If you are certain your health related problem is caused by some kind of wireless aggression, the first thing you need to do is to seek a wireless communications expert or engineer and ask him/her to audit your home , work place (or other place you find it to be the root cause) to setup measurement devices (more than 2) , for electromagnetic radiation detection (or other, for instance photonics, also known as lasers) and do active monitoring 24/7. The monitoring setup needs to be able to do sensor data measurements uploads to an experimental data repository (see table 1 above). At the same time is a mandatory requirement to notify authorities and include the web address link where sensor data is being uploaded and stored.

⚠️ **Only after you have those data measurements is advised to go to a conventional medical doctor / medicine.**

## Home Automation Safety & Health
(list of open hardware devices i prototyped to this date)

- **Indoor Plants**
  - [Indoor Smart Plant Watering with builtin micro wave LED Jammer](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Indoor-Smart-Plant-Watering)
  
This Smart Indoor plant monitoring and watering is designed to be inserted into any indoor plant vase. Is able to measure and calculate the moisture content in the vase, and when detects low water contents, activates the water pump. Is able to connect to a local home server to upload indoor temperature, humidity, and air quality measurement data. This way, the owner, can have a history record database, without the need for expensive cloud subscriptions.  Additionally, it features a 6 LED system composed of an ultraviolet LED, an Infrared LED and an RGB LED, when combined with multiple devices like this one in the same room is able to perform some basic light aggression protection from an unknown light source outside during the night & day.

- **On any room in a buidling**
  - [Smart Indoor Environement EM RF Energy Monitor](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Smart-Indoor-Environment-EM-RF-Energy-Monitor)
  
  This Smart Indoor Environment EM RF Energy Monitor does not solve the electromagnetic health concern one may have indoors. However, is a step forward in correctly identifying such electromagnetic disturbances nearby, for instance, when observing recurrently a mid-air energy spike, with the most common visual effect, a really small bright light flash. This smart device is able to do electromagnetic (EM) radio frequency (RF) measurements in a room and send data measurements to a local home server, alternatively to a public cloud server (for instance, to the authorities). Another important characteristic of this smart device is in the ability to deliver data to a server with a Unique Data Fingerprint Identification (UDF-ID),  which makes collected data more trustworthy of its origins.
  
  - [Smart Indoor Environement GSM 4G Cell Tower Identification](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Smart-Indoor-Environement-GSM-4G-Cell-Tower-Identification)
  
  This Smart Indoor Env. GSM Cell Tower Monitor is built to do active monitoring of GSM Cell Towers nearby to look for any kind of hidden GSM/4G device repeater. Known to be used for stealing one's GSM communications data using some kind of Man-in-the-middle attack. This smart device is able to do GSM/4G radio frequency (RF) measurements in a room and send data measurements to a local home server, alternatively to a public cloud server (for instance, to the authorities). Another important characteristic of this smart device is in the ability to deliver data to a server with a Unique Data Fingerprint Identification (UDF-ID), which makes collected data more trustworthy of its origins.

## Comercial Health Related Wearables 
I recommend wearing of a "Medical Grade" smartwatch when you know there's abnormal electromagnetic / photonic activity in the spaces most frequented (home, office, etc). The minimum specifications and requirements are:
- Telemedicine, i.e., sharing of medical* data with others throguh the  mobile app (see smartwatch suggested below)
- Able to upload all medical* data to a custom data repository, for instance to a dataverse (www.dataverse.org) (I haven't found one to date with this capabiltiy. Any manufacturer here willing to open source their firmware and mobile app source code? I am willing to help and program this and other important functionalities ) .
- Ability to measure REM sleep during the night (see smartwatch suggested below)
- App wiht ability to plot data measurements in a chart (see smartwatch suggested below) for one to make instananeuous snapshots to doodle and comment when in an urgent situatiuon or in urgent need.  

For the remainder of 2023 and first half of 2024 the OEM smartwatch i recommned is sold on Aliexpress [here](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdOPKhh). 

⚠️ **Important remarks**
- Accuracy of the smartwatch is not the top most important requirement. What is important is for you to know the brand and model of all sensors builtin into the smartwatch.
- Smart watches are mainly electronics devices and are prone to electromagnetic and even photonic interference., causing temporary malfunction and incorrect sensor measurements. This is expected for this kind of devices. Therefore, it is important the user to be willing to learn and document all errors a smartwatch may produce when collecting sensor measurements and append it to any kind of abnormal event it maybe happening, simply because it is, most likely, a result of some kind of a wireless aggression.

### Useful links 
Below is a list of links with useful information about these kind of abusive and many times criminous and terrorist usages.

**Exposure limits * Electric and magnetic fields in daily life * Regulation and control * Research and recommendations** <br>
Alternating fields with an extremely low frequency generate an electric current in the body. If the alternating fields are strong enough, this generated current can disrupt the functioning of nerves and muscles in the body and cause flashes of light in the field of vision. According to the recommendation of the Council 1999/519/EC, the following threshold values must not be exceeded by the fields so that these effects do not occur:
- for the electric field, the limit is 5 kilovolt per metre (5000 V/m or 5 kV/m);
- for the magnetic field, the limit is 100 microtesla (100 µT).
