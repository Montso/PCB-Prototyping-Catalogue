# Home Automation Safety & Health

<br>

### Safety usage of the smart devices provided below

The smart safety & health solutions available below, are for the kind of wireless aggression that behaves like ripples in a pond. For instance Wireless electromagnetic radios, including those found on smartphones, tablets, wifi routers at home, and many more. (except those with "5G" technologies)

**Are not able to detect wireless aggressions targeted to a person's body and individual. For instance, using some kind of beam-forming device or technologies**. For example, Laser and laser-like kind of devices and kind of technologies. 

**When installing any of the solutions provided below, take action and be conscient the aggression/aggressor may change to other types and kinds of "wireless devices" these smart devices below are unable to detect**.  

**Always use the smart devices below connected to a public data repository with LIVE data streams. While at the same time, notice authorities and provide the web address link where the public data repository can be found**. Data repositories based on Harvard's www.dataverse.org are currently the most suited (not ideal) for the smart solutions provided below. 

**Be advised**


Known open data repositories partially compatible with these smart devices:
- www.dataverse.org [partial compatible] (open firmware provided here uses a dataverse repository API)
- www.figshare.com [partial compatible]
- www.datadryad.org [not compatible; no API]

## [Home Automation Safety & Health](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/Home%20Automation%20Safety%20%26%20Health)
- **Indoor Plants**
  - [Indoor Smart Plant Watering with builtin micro wave LED Jammer](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Indoor-Smart-Plant-Watering)
  
This Smart Indoor plant monitoring and watering is designed to be inserted into any indoor plant vase. Is able to measure and calculate the moisture content in the vase, and when detects low water contents, activates the water pump. Is able to connect to a local home server to upload indoor temperature, humidity, and air quality measurement data. This way, the owner, can have a history record database, without the need for expensive cloud subscriptions.  Additionally, it features a 6 LED system composed of an ultraviolet LED, an Infrared LED and an RGB LED, when combined with multiple devices like this one in the same room is able to perform some basic light aggression protection from an unknown light source outside during the night & day.

  - [Smart Wireless Sonic/Sound Wave Active Monitoring](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/Home-Automation/Smart%20Wireless%20Wave%20Safety/readme.md) (soon...stay tuned!)
  - [Smart Wireless with spectrometer microwave active Monitoring and analysis](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/Home-Automation/Smart%20Wireless%20Wave%20Safety/readme.md) (soon...stay tuned!)

- **On any room in a buidling**
  - [Smart Indoor Environement EM RF Energy Monitor](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Smart-Indoor-Environment-EM-RF-Energy-Monitor)
  
  This Smart Indoor Environment EM RF Energy Monitor does not solve the electromagnetic health concern one may have indoors. However, is a step forward in correctly identifying such electromagnetic disturbances nearby, for instance, when observing recurrently a mid-air energy spike, with the most common visual effect, a really small bright light flash. This smart device is able to do electromagnetic (EM) radio frequency (RF) measurements in a room and send data measurements to a local home server, alternatively to a public cloud server (for instance, to the authorities). Another important characteristic of this smart device is in the ability to deliver data to a server with a Unique Data Fingerprint Identification (UDF-ID),  which makes collected data more trustworthy of its origins.
  
  - [Smart Indoor Environement GSM 4G Cell Tower Identification](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-Smart-Indoor-Environement-GSM-4G-Cell-Tower-Identification)
  
  This Smart Indoor Env. GSM Cell Tower Monitor is built to do active monitoring of GSM Cell Towers nearby to look for any kind of hidden GSM/4G device repeater. Known to be used for stealing one's GSM communications data using some kind of Man-in-the-middle attack. This smart device is able to do GSM/4G radio frequency (RF) measurements in a room and send data measurements to a local home server, alternatively to a public cloud server (for instance, to the authorities). Another important characteristic of this smart device is in the ability to deliver data to a server with a Unique Data Fingerprint Identification (UDF-ID), which makes collected data more trustworthy of its origins.
