# Useful utilities 

One can find here useful utilities to use when designing and prototyping PCB electronics. For instance a simple Excel spreadsheet with a resistance divider finder compatible with all sold on Aliexpress.Click on each individual file above to download.

- [resist divider calculator.xlsx](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/useful_utilities/resist%20divider%20calculator.xlsx) suitable for the ICs AUR9718, ST1S09
- [resist divider calculator - MP8765.xlsx](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/useful_utilities/resist%20divider%20calculator%20-%20MP8765.xlsx) suitable for the IC MT8765

These are Excel spreadsheets with all values of SMD resistors typically sold on AliExpress. This spreadsheet allows one to determine a pair of resistances to use for a given resistance divider (R1/R2)


No one likes to work "for free". If you like my work, and use it, please consider supporting it. Links at the top, bottom, and right side pane.
Thank you.
