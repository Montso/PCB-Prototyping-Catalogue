# Useful utilities 

One can find here usefull utilities to use when designing and prototyping pcb electronics. For instance a simple excel spreadsheet with a resistance divider finder compatible with all sold on aliexpress.Click on each individual file above to download .

- [resist divider calculator.xlsx](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/useful_utilities/resist%20divider%20calculator.xlsx) suitable for the ICs AUR9718, ST1S09
- [resist divider calculator - MP8765.xlsx](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/useful_utilities/resist%20divider%20calculator%20-%20MP8765.xlsx) suitable for the IC MT8765

These are excel spreadsheet with all values of SMD resitors typically sold on AliExpress. This spreadsheet allows one to determine pair of resistances to use for a given resistance divider (R1/R2)

No one likes to work "for free". If you like my work, and use it, please consider supporting it. Links at the top, bottom and right side pane.

Thank you.
