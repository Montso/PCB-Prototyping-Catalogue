## Vehicle Automation

Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, are revolutionizing the transportation industry. These vehicles utilize advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, sensors, and cameras to navigate and operate without human intervention. By eliminating the need for a human driver, autonomous vehicles offer numerous benefits. They enhance road safety by minimizing human error, increase efficiency by optimizing routes and reducing traffic congestion, and provide mobility options for those who cannot drive, such as the elderly or disabled. Additionally, autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future. While there are still challenges to overcome, such as regulatory frameworks and public acceptance, autonomous vehicles hold great promise for transforming our transportation systems and improving the way we move from one place to another.

What's planned for 2024.... <br>
The electrical system and electronics for all Volvo's with the common chassis MKII, period 1998 to 2005, using the existing wiring on those cars (backward compatible) and replacing all electronics with open hardware I will design and prototype. To achieve this task I will be using donor car electronics and electrical wiring I already have. This will serve as a ground base to commercialize automotive solutions using an open business logic (open hardware and open software) for other car brands and models. Including LPG systems.

**The problem** <br>
Nowadays, repairing hardware electronics is impossible or almost impossible. Current practice forces a car owner to replace instead of repair. This has a really high cost and pushes owners to seek other less trustworthy solutions using used components from other vehicles. Since this type of components is nowadays heavily protected, maintenance and repair outside the official car manufacturer authorized dealer poses additional risks every time a piece of hardware electronics or firmware requires reverse engineering and modification just to enable it and make it work in another vehicle.

**The Ideia** <br>
Design and prototype an OEM hardware electronics capable to the same operation and functionality, however instead of using closed and protected logic, it uses open hardware and open firmware hardware electronics as a direct replacement into existing* wiring in a vehicle, in particular older cars. This will facilitate repeatability and maintenance on any "repair shop" outside authorized dealers. And requires no reverse engineering and no modification to make it work in a vehicle.<br>

Since this is an open hardware project, the main selection of choice for the operating system will be Android Auto for the main LCD screen , in the center console. Nowadays there are a plenitude of "open auto" solutions using a raspberry pi. I'll be designing the hardware electronics made to fit an SoC module, and i'll be starting with NVidia's Jetson Nano. In the following YouTube video there's a good example of a traditional media unit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgbHXTHUnQw
