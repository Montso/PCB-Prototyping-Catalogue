### Fully assembled PCB
Alternatively, and if you do not want to build a PCB by yourself and like to buy one:

[Tindie.com](https://www.tindie.com/stores/aeonlabs/)

The price starts at 30eur plus postage fees.
(I will also deliver the assembled PCB with all the components in place at a fair aditonal cost).

#### Be supportive of my dedication and work towards technology education and buy me a coffee. Link below.

## Firmware Download / Burner
one can use the PCB in the repository [AeonLabs-MCU-Burner-USB-to-UART-TTL](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-MCU-Burner-USB-to-UART-TTL) to program the PCBs.
