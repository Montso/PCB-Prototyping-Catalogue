# PCB Prototype Catalogue
░ ░AeonLabs, a personal brand of Miguel T., is about conceptualization, design, and prototyping of technology solutions for Enterprise businesses and Institutions. To know more about the author visit his [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/migueltomas/). <br> 
░ ░This repository is the main catalogue for all PCB prototyped and publicly available here on GitHub. There are now a total of **39** PCBs for smart devices, A.I. enabled, designed in KiCad and ready to download, order fabrication at a PCB factory or buy them on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/aeonlabs/) ready to install and use. See the list of [fully tested & ready to use PCB designs](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/wiki/Fully-tested-&-ready-to-use-PCB-designs).<br>
░ ░In my PCB projects i give preference to [EspressIF ESP32 line of microchips](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DepDnsn). However designs are not limited to EspressIF.  While the reader browses this catalogue, don't forget to read the [Wiki](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/wiki) full of useful information about all smart PCBs available here.

# Available PCB Designs as KiCad Project files for DIY and Makers

[<img src="https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/tindie_amazing_small.jpg" alt="" height="60">](https://www.tindie.com/stores/aeonlabs/)


This public PCB catalogue features PCB desings that are not fully tested or require minor changes to the PCB or shcematics. Suited to all DIY and Makers in electronics, however a regular user may find him/her self in need to read components datasheets before any usage of the PCB is possible.

If time (or datasheets) are not your thing, there are more PCB designs with circuit schematics fully tested and working ready to download, available to all who donate or sponsor my open hardware work. Click [here for fully tested PCB designs and circuit chematics](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/Fully-Tested-Working-PCB-Catalogue).

## Get a free custom PCB for your DIY or Maker projects
Get a Free PCB for yourself!
Send me your device, hardware or equipment and i will design a custom PCB for it. Free of charge. What i accept:

- Home appliances
- Office appliances
- Industrial and commercial tools, equipment, machinery and appliances.

I will design your custom PCB for your DIY or Maker projects. Free of charge. Contact-me on WhatsApp, Telegram or WeChat to know how. Or email me at mtpsilva@gmail.com for more info.  Links above.

<br />

## Order a custom made PCB delivered at your door
Is possible to own or licence any of the PCB designs publicly available here. Order custom made, design and assembled PCBs according to the buyer specifications.

Buyer will get a more porfessional PCB without usage of any fast deployment PCB modules available elsewhere on the internet, and instead, with all components built into the PCB.  

Logos and markings are also delivered according to the buyer specifications. All PCBs are CE ready, meaning the buyer can certify the PCB and use the CE certification watermark on his products and services.

**What is included**
- access to the private repository
- unlimited download of the KiCad project files
  - fully annotated circuit schematics
  - ready PCB design
  - BOM components directly available on KiCad 
- open issue tickets
- future PCB minor revisions (major revision increments not included) 
- Custom firmware (only to commercial users) acording to user specifications:
  - firmware support on Whatsapp and Telegram for the major revision hardware , i.e., all minor revisions included
  - support on WhatsApp and Telegram how to do firmware download to the PCB

Available private PCBs are listed above, mixed with public acessible PCBs. Or instead, access all private PCBs available [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/Fully-Tested-Working-PCB-Catalogue).
