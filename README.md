# PCB Prototype Catalogue
This is the catalogue for all PCB prototyped and publicly available here on GitHub AeonLabs, a personal brand of [Miguel T.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/migueltomas/). There are now a total of **36** PCBs for smart devices, A.I. enabled, designed in KiCad and ready to download, fabrication or order on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/aeonlabs/).
In my PCB projects i give preference to [EspressIF ESP32 microchip](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DepDnsn). However designs are not limited to ESP32.  

Don't forget to read the [Wiki](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/wiki) full of useful information about all smart PCBs available here.

## Firmware Download / Burner
To make any of the available PCBs here running as intented is needed to download into it a binary program. Anyone can use the PCB available on this repository [AeonLabs-MCU-Burner-USB-to-UART-TTL](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-MCU-Burner-USB-to-UART-TTL) to fabricate a USB to UART MCU program downloader. Compatible with Arduino Studio, VS Code and Visual Studio programming IDEs (among many others)
