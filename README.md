<br />

## Firmware Download / Burner
To make any of the available PCBs here running as intented is needed to download into it a binary program. Anyone can use the PCB available on this repository [AeonLabs-MCU-Burner-USB-to-UART-TTL](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-MCU-Burner-USB-to-UART-TTL) to fabricate a USB to UART MCU program downloader. Compatible with Arduino Studio, VS Code and Visual Studio programming IDEs (among many others)

## Fully tested and Ready to use PCBs 

This public PCB catalogue features PCB desings that are not fully tested or require minor changes to the PCB or shcematics. Suited to all DIY and Makers in electronics, however a regular user may find him/her self in need to read components datasheets before any usage of the PCB is possible. 

If time (or datasheets) are not your thing, there are more PCB designs with circuit schematics fully tested and working ready to download, available to all who donate or sponsor my work.

Is quite simple, simply click on any of sponsor buttons at the top, left side bar or at the bottom. The minimum amount to access the private repositories with PCB design files is a one time fee of 20 USD. 

**What is included**
- access to the private repository
- unlimited download of the KiCad project files
  - fully annotated circuit schematics
  - ready PCB design
  - BOM components directly available on KiCad 
- open issue tickets
- future PCB minor revisions (major revision increments not included) 
- Custom firmware (only to commercial users) acording to user specifications:
  - firmware support on Whatsapp and Telegram for the major revision hardware , i.e., all minor revisions included
  - support on WhatsApp and Telegram how to do firmware download to the PCB

Available private PCBs are listed above, mixed with public acessible PCBs. Or instead, access all private PCBs available [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/Fully-Tested-Working-PCB-Catalogue).
