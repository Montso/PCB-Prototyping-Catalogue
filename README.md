 ## DIY vs PRO revision of a PCB 

**PRO**

The PRO revision is a fully assembled PCB ready to install and use. Is fully tested and functional. No need of soldering components. This revision is suitable to individual consumers fans of open hardware and open source, but don't have the minimum skills to assemble one for him/herself. The PRO revision is suitable to enterprises and business owners in particular those doing IT consulting, Enterprise Digital Transformation and even Technology Advisory. There are two options to get a PRO smart PCB device:
- Subscribe to the repository with the specific PCB you want (one time subscription fee to sponsor my open hardware work dedication and fairness of work). Download the Gerber files and order fabrication & components assembly on your favorite PCB factory.
- Order one , fully assembled and ready to use directly on AeonLabs Tidie.com store. Link below.

**DIY**

The DIY revision is a PCB for Do It Yourself Makers and also for electronics hobbyists and professionals. The DIY revision is a PCB that may use any pre fabricated pcb modules sold on the internet. For instance [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/category/17). For instance [sparkfun's](https://www.sparkfun.com) modules and many more. This revision most likely has some kind of pcb bug that needs attention and correction before ordering fabrication on ALLPCB or PCBWay. This means it requires some degree of knowledge in electronics and components. Make sure to check the development status in the corresponding PCB repository. To get a DIY revision of a PCB simply navigate the publicly available repositories liested on this catalogue.

**All PCBs available are ready for**

## Firmware Download / Burner
To make any of the available PCBs here running as intented is needed to download into it a binary program. Anyone can use the PCB available on this repository [AeonLabs-MCU-Burner-USB-to-UART-TTL](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-MCU-Burner-USB-to-UART-TTL) to fabricate a USB to UART MCU program downloader. Compatible with Arduino Studio, VS Code and Visual Studio programming IDEs (among many others)

# Publicly available PCB Designs as KiCad Project files for DIY and Makers

[![](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/tindie_amazing_small.jpg)](https://www.tindie.com/stores/aeonlabs/)

This public PCB catalogue features PCB desings that are not fully tested or require minor changes to the PCB or shcematics. Suited to all DIY and Makers in electronics, however a regular user may find him/her self in need to read components datasheets before any usage of the PCB is possible.

If time (or datasheets) are not your thing, there are more PCB designs with circuit schematics fully tested and working ready to download, available to all who donate or sponsor my open hardware work.
