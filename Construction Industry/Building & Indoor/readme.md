This public PCB catalogue features PCB desings that are not fully tested or require minor changes to the PCB or shcematics. Suited to all DIY and Makers in electronics, however a regular user may find him/her self in need to read components datasheets before any usage of the PCB is possible.

If time (or datasheets) are not your thing, there are more PCB designs with circuit schematics fully tested and working ready to download, available to all who donate or sponsor my open hardware work. Click [here for fully tested PCB designs and circuit chematics](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/Fully-Tested-Working-PCB-Catalogue). To order a custom PCB acording to your specifications and needs , go [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/custom_PCB).


## [Home Automation](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/Home-Automation/README.md)
- [Smart Wireless Wave Safety](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/Home-Automation/Smart%20Wireless%20Wave%20Safety)
- [AeonLabs LDAD for Legrand Plexo Junction box](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-LDAD-for-Legrand-Plexo)
 
 LDAD PCB for a direct fit on [Legrand Plexo](https://www.legrand.com/ecatalogue/RESIDENTIAL-BUILDINGS-AND-HOTEL-EQUIPMENT/weatherproof-wiring-accessories-and-other-installation-equipment:5/weatherproof-wiring-accessories-and-boxes:1/plexo-boxes-ip-55-ik-07-with-direct-entry-membrane-glands-650-c:12/square-boxes:2/65-x-) Junction Box with 65x65x40xmm. Features WIFI, BLE & Bluetooth 5.x connectivity and can connect up to 10 sensors. This PCB is powered with any 220V AC line. If wireless is not possible this PCB is able to connect to a Home #CanBus network for data transmission (and receive) up to 1Mbit/s.The perfect #PCB for managing construction site works since early construction stages, while, for instance, concreting structural elements. Later on can be left and integrated with any home automation system for active structural and environmental monitoring. Simple and compatible with existing tools and technologies. Can't get better than this !!!
