# Smart PCB devices for the Construction Industry

### Available PCB Designs as KiCad Project files for DIY and Makers

[<img src="https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/blob/main/tindie_amazing_small.jpg" alt="" height="60">](https://www.tindie.com/stores/aeonlabs/)


This public PCB catalogue features PCB desings that are not fully tested or require minor changes to the PCB or shcematics. Suited to all DIY and Makers in electronics, however a regular user may find him/her self in need to read components datasheets before any usage of the PCB is possible.

If time (or datasheets) are not your thing, there are more PCB designs with circuit schematics fully tested and working ready to download, available to all who donate or sponsor my open hardware work. Click [here for fully tested PCB designs and circuit chematics](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/Fully-Tested-Working-PCB-Catalogue). To order a custom PCB acording to your specifications and needs , go [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/tree/main/custom_PCB).
